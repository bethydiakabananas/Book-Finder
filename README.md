# Book-Finder

## What it does

Need help finding a good book? Use Book Finder to discover the latest best-sellers in various genres. You can ask Alexa to find a good book and she will tell you about the best-selling fiction books according to the New York Times. You can even suggest a genre, such as children's or comedy, and Alexa will tell you the best-selling books in that category. You can also ask the Echo to go into detail about certain books that it's already mentioned by saying "Tell me more about the first" or "I want to know more about the second." All official data about best-selling books is from the New York Times via the New York Times Books API.

## Usecases

1. Just ask for any book (the application will give details about the best-selling fiction book).

2. Ask for a book from a specific genre or topic such as romance or science fiction (the application will give details about the best-selling book from the given topic based on data from the New York Times).

3. Get details about a certain book that Alexa has already said. For example, after asking the app "What are some good fiction books?," the app will say the title of the best-selling book, its description, and the titles of two other books. The user can say "Tell me more about the second" or "Tell me more about the third" to hear more details about the other two books.
